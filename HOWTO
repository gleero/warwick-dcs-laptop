     * Get a SVN checkout of the Debian Installer:
          http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/svn

 * Install the build-dependencies for the Debian Installer with
   `apt-get build-dep debian-installer`

 * Build the `curl-static` udeb using the latest Curl upstream tarball
   from Debian.  You may have to sync the local debian/changelog.

 * Build the `warwick-dcs-laptop` udeb. It is a "Debian native"
   package.

 * If you want to allow users to specify the suite to install, rebuild the
   `choose-mirror` udeb with the following patch:

      --- a/packages/choose-mirror/choose-mirror.c

              return 0;
       }

 * Copy the udebs into the `installer/build/localudebs/` directory.

 * Include the preseed.cfg by creating `installer/build/config/local` with
   the contents:

     PRESEED = /path/to/preseed.cfg

 * Include the warwick-dcs-laptop in the package lists by creating
   `installer/build/pkg-lists/local` with the contents:

     warwick-dcs-laptop

   `make` to see the possible targets.
