To install:

 * Build the `curl-static` udeb using the latest Curl upstream tarball
   from Debian.  You may have to sync the local debian/changelog.

 * Build the `warwick-dcs-laptop` udeb. It is a "Debian native"
   package.

 * Get a SVN checkout of the Debian Installer:
      http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/svn

 * Copy the udebs into the `installer/build/localudebs/` directory.

 * Include the preseed.cfg by creating `installer/build/config/local` with
   the contents:

     PRESEED = /path/to/preseed.cfg

 * Build the installer from the `installer/build/` directory. You can run
   `make` to see the possible targets.
